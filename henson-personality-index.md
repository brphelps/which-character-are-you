Here’s a single merged system (built from both docs) that keeps the *behavioral dynamics* clarity of HCDI and the *Muppets-vs-Sesame separation power* of MSPI, but **every dimension is 1–10**.  

## Unified Henson Character Inventory (UHCI)

### 1) Event Drive (ED): Reactive ↔ Agentic

**1** = mostly responds/gets swept along • **10** = initiates, steers, organizes outcomes
(= HCDI “Agency vs Reactivity”) 

### 2) Emotional Containment (EC): Explosive ↔ Regulated

**1** = impulsive/expressive chaos • **10** = tightly controlled/contained
(= HCDI “Regulation vs Expressivity” + MSPI “Impulse Control”)  

### 3) Social Aim (SA): Self-Directed/Oppositional ↔ Communal/Nurturing

**1** = anti-social, contrarian, self-first • **10** = pro-social, cooperative, caregiving
(= HCDI “Communal vs Performative” *plus* MSPI’s communal-vs-self-directed core, so it works for Oscar *and* Kermit)  

### 4) Reality Lens (RL): Concrete/Literal ↔ Absurd/Surreal

**1** = concrete, rule-based, earnest literalism • **10** = embraces nonsense, surreal logic, playful contradiction
(= HCDI “Literal vs Absurdist” + the practical effect of MSPI “Cognitive Style”)  

### 5) Show-Awareness (SH): Immersed ↔ Meta/Performative

**1** = fully sincere/immersed in-world • **10** = openly performative, fourth-wall-adjacent
(= MSPI “Meta-Awareness” and the key “secret sauce” separating the franchises) 

### 6) Behavioral Stability (BS): Volatile ↔ Steady

**1** = rapidly shifting mood/goals/persona • **10** = consistent across contexts
(= HCDI “Stability vs Volatility”) 

## Quick “translation” from the two originals

* **HCDI → UHCI:** Agency→ED, Regulation→EC, Social Orientation→SA, Cognitive Framing→RL, Stability→BS 
* **MSPI → UHCI:** IC→EC, SO→SA, CS→RL (mostly), MA→SH; AA (authority alignment) is *implicitly distributed* across ED+SA+EC (rule-enforcers tend to be steadier/more regulated; defiers tend to be more self-directed and/or volatile).
